# Data Storage & Versioning

So we now have our development environment. However, the data for us to
conduct EDA and predictive modeling on is nowhere in sight.

Since the context of this guide is within the Google Cloud Platform,
we will be making use of its
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
service for remote and object storage.

In most cases, raw data for 100E projects provided by the project
sponsors are uploaded to GCS through AI Singapore's
in-house tool for uploading data: UDP. When data is uploaded to GCS
through UDP, a GCS bucket is populated with timestamped directories
containing whatever raw that was uploaded.

__For example__, assuming your GCP project ID is `ai-proj-aut0`,
a GCS bucket with a similar name like `ai-proj-aut0` should exist.
The tree in the bucket can look something like this:

```bash
.
└── ai-proj-aut0
    ├── 20211214_1109568/
    ├── 20211214_1110821/
    ├── 20211214_1448200/
    └── 20211214_1449172/
```

The subdirectories are timestamps indicative of the time that the raw
data was added to GCS. A question that follows is how do we get
the data into the persistent storage that's accessible by Polyaxon's
jobs and services? Well, let's go back to the VSCode environment to use
the integrated terminal.

From
[this section](./04-dev-env.md#cloud-sdk-for-development-environment),
we've learned how to set up authorisation for `gcloud`
to use the service account
credentials we have attached to the service containers.
This means that we can use
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
to pull in data from a GCS bucket.

=== "Polyaxon VSCode Terminal"

    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/ai-proj-aut0 && cd "$_"
    $ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://ai-proj-aut0 .
    ```

The `-m` flag is to utilise parallel synchronisation which would speed
things up and the `-r` concerns recursion through a bucket/directory.

Now, when a new set of raw data has been uploaded, a new subdirectory
will appear in the bucket. Say the tree now looks like the following:

```bash
.
└── ai-proj-aut0
    ├── 20211215_0952332/
    ├── 20211214_1109568/
    ├── 20211214_1110821/
    ├── 20211214_1448200/
    └── 20211214_1449172/
```

To retrieve that new set of raw data i.e. the folder `20211215_0952332`,
just run the same command in the relevant folder again:

=== "Polyaxon VSCode Terminal"

    ```bash
    $ cd /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/ai-proj-aut0
    $ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://ai-proj-aut0 .
    ```

The `gsutil` utility will synchronise the directory in the persistent
storage with the remote object storage/bucket.
With that said, __do not place your processed data directory within
this same directory containing all the raw data__ lest you'd lose
the processed data upon sychronisation. Let the directory for raw data
contain just raw data.

## Processed/Intermediary Data

As mentioned, raw data for 100E projects are located in a default
GCS bucket within each GCP project,
usually with the convention `gs://<GCP_PROJECT_ID>-aut0`.
However, that default bucket __should only contain raw data__.
Each project should create a separate GCS bucket for processed or any
other form of data.

Say one would like to create a GCS bucket with the name
`aiap-team6-miniproject-proc-data`, the following command can
be used:

=== "Local Machine / Polyaxon VSCode Terminal"

    ```bash
    $ gsutil mb -p aiap-10-ds -c STANDARD -l ASIA-SOUTHEAST1 -b on gs://aiap-team6-miniproject-proc-data
    Creating gs://aiap-team6-miniproject-proc-data/...
    ```

!!! note
    Something to take note for the future is that
    GCS buckets are to adhere to the naming guidelines set by GCP, one
    of which is that bucket names must be globally unique.
    See
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming-buckets)
    for more information on naming guidelines for GCS buckets. DO look
    into the naming conventions for GCS objects
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming-objects)
    as well.

## Sample Data

While you may have your own project data to work with, for the purpose
of following through with this template guide, let's download
the sample data for the
[sample problem statement](./02-preface.md#guides-problem-statement)
at hand.

!!! info
    The sample data for this guide's problem statement is made
    accessible to the public. Hence any team or individual can download
    it. It is highly likely that your project's data is not
    publicly accessible
    and neither should it be, especially if it is a 100E project.

=== "Polyaxon VSCode Terminal"

    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p /polyaxon-v1-data/workspaces/<YOUR_NAME>/data/acl-movie-review-data-aisg && cd "$_"
    $ gsutil -m rsync -r gs://acl-movie-review-data-aisg .
    ```

In the following section, we will work towards processing the raw data
and eventually training a sentiment classifier model.
