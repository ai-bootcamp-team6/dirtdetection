## Team 6: Dirt Detection Project

### Context:

We are a team of 6 apprentices coming together at the end of a bootcamp to create a AI/ML project for a model deployment presentation.

It took us 3 and a half days to complete this project. The model architecture is taken from the DirtNet paper listed below.

The dataset is curated and augmented by the same team responsible for the paper.

The YOLOv3 implementation is taken from ultralytics.

The model is locally deployed to Streamlit with FastAPI.

### Live Detection

The live detection feature is a simple inference call with source directed to the computer's webcam.
